              <h3>About Me:</h3>
              <p>Currently working full time and learning to code part time! I’m happy to be a part of the Thinkful community so I can explore this field I have come to develop a passion for on a much deeper level, web development. My journey started with some basic self learning through Youtube and random blog articles but eventually grew to several structured Udemy Courses. After taking myself a ways down the solo learning path, I decided some structure and a community would fill in the many gaps I was missing. And so began the hunt. While listening to one of the many coding podcasts I subscribe to, I came across a particularly inspiring interview of someone who was not only on a similar path as me but also went through Thinkful’s Engineering Flex program and had very successful outcomes. Long story short, a couple weeks later I was here! I am excited to not only be learning these new skills but also be in an environment where I can work closely with a large group of like minded aspiring developers. Looking forward to all this course has to offer! </p>
